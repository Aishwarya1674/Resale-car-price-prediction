## Problem : ##
  Buying or selling a used car can be confusing because it's hard to know if the price is fair.Buyers might overpay, and sellers might not get what their car is worth. People often rely on guesswork or outdated information, leading to unfair deals. 

## Introduction:  ## 
  Our project aims to solve this problem by using data science and machine learning to predict used car prices accurately. By analyzing factors like age, mileage, and market trends, we want to provide a reliable platform that helps buyers and sellers make informed decisions, making the used car market more transparent and fair for everyone.
